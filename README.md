# hayleyrodgers-professional-portfolio

## Description

My goal for this project was to create a personal portfolio to collate samples of my work. This is to showcase my skills and experience to prospective employers so they can determine whether I might be a good fit for their company.

To achieve this, I used HTML and CSS.

During this project, I consolidated my understanding of HTML and CSS. In particular, I re-inforced what I have learnt about:
- CSS variables
- The box model and flexbox
- Media queries
- Commenting on HTML and CSS
- Wireframes
- VS Code
- Terminal
- And, GitHub.
